Hi! 👋🏻

I am Alejandro, an experienced Software Developer with almost 9 years of experience in the industry. I am currently working as **Senior Software Developer @ GEOTAB**, a global leader in vehicle fleet management solutions. My focus includes real-time data ingestion, algorithm optimization, ensuring adherence to evolving regulatory requirements, and developing performant and user-friendly interfaces.

Also, as side projects, I have been working on [ComedoresUGRbot](https://github.com/alejandrocq/ComedoresUGRbot), [energy-manager](https://github.com/alejandrocq/energy-manager) or my [personal website](https://github.com/alejandrocq/personal-website). You can visit the latest at [alejandro-castilla.com](https://alejandro-castilla.com).

Apart from that, I run my personal home server where I run services for my everyday needs like email, VPN, file storage... and so on, which leverage my skills in system administration.

Last but not least, I do simracing 🏎️ 🏁 as a hobby (or should we say obsession?) and I am currently contributing to [Simulator-Controller](https://github.com/SeriousOldMan/Simulator-Controller) with minor but useful contributions that leverage my passion for simracing and software development.
